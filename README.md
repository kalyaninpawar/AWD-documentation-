# **Amazon Web Services Documentation**


### Abstract
 Amazon Web Services offers a broad set of global cloud-based products including compute, storage,
databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security, and
enterprise applications: on-demand, available in seconds, with pay-as-you-go pricing. From data
warehousing to deployment tools, directories to content delivery, over 200 AWS services are available.
New services can be provisioned quickly, without the upfront capital expense. This allows enterprises,
start-ups, small and medium-sized businesses, and customers in the public sector to access the building
blocks they need to respond quickly to changing business requirements. This whitepaper provides you
with an overview of the benefits of the AWS Cloud and introduces you to the services that make up the
platform.

### Introduction
In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses as web
servicesâ€”now commonly known as cloud computing. One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the
opportunity to replace upfront capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs that scale with
your business. With the cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT
infrastructure weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of
servers in minutes and deliver results faster.
Today, AWS provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers
hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world.

 ### What is a Client-Server Model?
 * In computing, a client can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers. A server can be services such    as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a type of virtual server.

*  For example, suppose that a client makes a request for a news article, the score in an online game, or a funny video. The server evaluates the details of this          request and fulfills it by returning the information to the client.


## What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).
