# **Amazon Web Services Documentation**


### Abstract
 Amazon Web Services offers a broad set of global cloud-based products including compute, storage,
databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security, and
enterprise applications: on-demand, available in seconds, with pay-as-you-go pricing. From data
warehousing to deployment tools, directories to content delivery, over 200 AWS services are available.
New services can be provisioned quickly, without the upfront capital expense. This allows enterprises,
start-ups, small and medium-sized businesses, and customers in the public sector to access the building
blocks they need to respond quickly to changing business requirements. This whitepaper provides you
with an overview of the benefits of the AWS Cloud and introduces you to the services that make up the
platform.

### Introduction
In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses as web
services—now commonly known as cloud computing. One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the
opportunity to replace upfront capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs that scale with
your business. With the cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT
infrastructure weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of
servers in minutes and deliver results faster.
Today, AWS provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers
hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world.

### What is a Client-Server Model?
 * In computing, a client can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers. A server can be services such    as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a type of virtual server.

*  For example, suppose that a client makes a request for a news article, the score in an online game, or a funny video. The server evaluates the details of this          request and fulfills it by returning the information to the client.

## What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and
other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
Whether you are running applications that share photos to millions of mobile users or you’re supporting
the critical operations of your business, a cloud services platform provides rapid access to flexible and
low-cost IT resources. With cloud computing, you don’t need to make large upfront investments in
hardware and spend a lot of time on the heavy lifting of managing that hardware. Instead, you can
provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need to power your newest bright
idea or operate your IT department. You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly, and
only pay for what you use.

Cloud computing provides a simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a broad set of
application services over the Internet. A cloud services platform such as Amazon Web Services owns and
maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision
and use what you need via a web application.

### Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
* **Trade capital expense for variable expense** – Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers
and servers before you know how you’re going to use them, you can pay only when you consume
computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.
* **Benefit from massive economies of scale** – By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower
variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers
is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which
translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.
* **Stop guessing capacity** – Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a
capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle
resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can
access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few
minutes’ notice.
* **Increase speed and agility** – In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away,
which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from
weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost
and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.
* **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers** – Focus on projects that differentiate
your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather
than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.
* **Go global in minutes** – Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just
a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at
minimal cost.
